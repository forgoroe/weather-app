#Weather app

Simple weather app that displays the current position, weather conditions and temperature (which can be viewed in Fahrenheit or Celsius).

I've tried not using jQuery at all, focusing more on pure javascript.

##Known issues

... Have been fixed :smiley:

Previous issues [#1](https://github.com/forgoroe/weather-app/issues/1) and [#2](https://github.com/forgoroe/weather-app/issues/2) have both been solved.

Weather-app now makes use of the Google API to retrieve the coordinates, making it possible to use this small "widget" on either Chrome or Firefox, *weather* :wink: you locally host the page or not.

[Github pages](https://forgoroe.github.io/weather-app/) or [codepen](http://codepen.io/Forgoroe/full/mAzxwA/) should now both work for you.

##Motivation

This project was made by following the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) user stories for the [weather app challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather).
